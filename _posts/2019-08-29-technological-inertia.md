With the start of the new decade I've been thinking
about what technologies might define it whether it be
(AR, AI, Edge Computing, 5G, etc.). When evaluating 
developments and trends in consumer tech and research, I found
myself continually thinking about the dynamics of how 
new technologies are adopted in society and make their way 
into the status quo. In particular, I came up with a 
concept I call *technological inertia*, whose definition
might be trivial, but I felt succinctly captures an important 
consideration when ideating.

### Definition
An idea has to be familiar enough that the learning/adoption curve is relatively
small such that it could be intially adopted by those who are comfortable with existing technological norms. 

However, the idea has to add enough value or novelty to existing solutions, that one would give up using pre-existing 
technology in order to use it. 

Consumers have inherent inertia, a tendency to stick with what works. When the balance of **familiarity and innovation** of an idea is not level, this inertial force is greater than the "force"(marketing, innovation, design) of an idea. Thus, leading to minimal or low adoption. If this balance is maintained, an idea will have a much better chance at being adopted. 


*Note: The term is derived from inertia in classical mechanics, which is an object's resistance to change or tendency to stay at rest.*
