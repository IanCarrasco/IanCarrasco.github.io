The chords used in jazz piano evoke a certain quality and richness that is achieved through the use of extensions and open voicings. Here, I quickly talk about two particular examples derived from Herbie Hancock and Kenny Barron that I particularly like.

## Kenny Baron Spread Voicing

The Kenny Baron voicing is built on a set of stacked fifth intervals (fifths) like so. It has a much more open sound compared to the following voicing due to the larger intervals in the right hand.

### Formula
<strong><span class="orange">Left Hand:</span></strong> Root - Up 5th - Up 5th

<strong><span class="orange">Right Hand:</span></strong> Minor or Major 3rd - Up 5th - Up 5th

### Example
Chord: Am7

Root note is A

Left  Hand: <strong><span class="green">A</span></strong> (Root) + <strong><span class="green">E</span></strong> (5th from A) + <strong><span class="green">B</span></strong> (5th from E)

Right Hand: <strong><span class="green">C</span></strong> (Minor 3rd in A) + <strong><span class="green">G</span></strong> (5th from C) + <strong><span class="green">D</span></strong> (5th from G)

## Herbie Hancock Spread Voicing

The Herbie Hancock voicing is built on a set of stacked fifth intervals (fifths) in the left hand similar to the Barron voicings but uses a more closed right hand which adds tension. (Major/Minor chord in 3rd inversion)

### Formula
<strong><span class="orange">Left Hand:</span></strong> Root - Up 5th - Up 5th

<strong><span class="orange">Right Hand:</span></strong> Minor/Major 6th - Up 4th - Up Minor 3rd

### Example
Chord: Am7

Root note is A

Left  Hand: <strong><span class="green">A</span></strong> (Root) + <strong><span class="green">E</span></strong> (5th from A) + <strong><span class="green">B</span></strong> (5th from E)

Right Hand: <strong><span class="green">G</span></strong> (Minor 6th in A) + <strong><span class="green">C</span></strong> (4th from G) + <strong><span class="green">Eb</span></strong> (Minor 3rd from C)
