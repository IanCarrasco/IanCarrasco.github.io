Questions are often seen (incorrectly) in many scenarios as illuminating one's lack of understanding. I mean you are asking a question because you didn't fully understand some information presented to you, right? Wrong. Questions are much more nuanced than they might seem in the crude form described above, a form which acts as a barrier for many people to ask a question in the first place. I view questions as one of the most powerful tools for understanding topics deeply, demonstrating knowledge, and having awareness of intricacies.

I believe to understand any topic you have to ask *yourself* the proper questions. For example, let's take machine learning as a topic. What techniques are used in machine learning? Why should I use this technique over another technique? Who are the people in X field I should be following? Obsessive question asking keeps your mind on edge and rewards naivety. By asking questions, that may seem so base or fundamental at the surface many people have a hard time answering them, which acts as a testament to is non-triviality. When you see young children there is a phase where the ask questions about the world in this obsessive way, as for them it is the only way to learn about why things are the way they are. As one gets older, however, question asking tends to slowly subsided, due to much more consideration of how the question might reflects one's internal state.
