## The Hickory House
A former jazz club on 52nd street in NYC, which I discovered after
listening to the Piano Jazz radio show hosted by Marian Macpartland, 
who was the club's resident pianist. 52nd street during the 1940s 
and 50s was the center of the NYC jazz scene, where you could 
find artists like Thelonius Monk, Art Tatum, and Billy Holliday 
performing regularly.

## Vickery Auctions
An auction format where the winner of the auction pays the price 
offered by the second highest bidder. Which removes the buyer's 
remorse associated with first-price auctions where you could end up
paying a much higher amount than you needed to in order to win an
auction. Mathematician Alon Amit describes Vickery (Second-Price) Auctions well:

> "In a first-price auction, you’re not bidding your true value, 
> you’re trying to guess what everyone else is going to bid and 
> then put down a bid that’s slightly higher than the next person’s 
> (unless you think someone is going to offer more than what you’re willing to pay, in which case you just bow out).
> In a second-price auction, there’s no reason for you to do that. 
> You can simply say exactly the maximum price you are willing to pay"

## Shannon Entropy
The average number of bits in order to encode a sequence of symbols based on the frequency of each symbol appearing.
It is represented by the following equation: &nbsp;

$$ 
H=-\sum_{i=1}^{M} P_i\,log_2\,P_i
$$
