This page is going to be an ongoing list of notes from talks/lectures I've watched.

## Ajay Banga - Taking Risks in Your Life and Career
- Going into a new company with a mindset of trying to learn from everyone.
    - Everyone knows something that you don't.
    - Have humility, but be bold enough to take risks.
- You have to enjoy what you are doing FIRST! If you aren't, find it.
- Take the time for what matters (Health, Family, Relationships)
    - And make sure to spend that time with people not devices
- Important to consider what **and how** you do something
- Deal with adversity, don't try to avoid it.
