In the coming posts, I'm going to break down some
of the foundational and recent work in neuroscience-inspired
AI or NeuroAI for short. I believe this field has a lot of 
promise in regards to building systems that have general 
intelligence. Current deep learning architectures under-represent
the structural and dynamical complexity of neurons and their correspoding
networks as seen in human brains.
