<h1 id="introduction-and-considerations">Introduction and Considerations</h1>

<p>Understanding how learning occurs in the brain is a key problem in neuroscience. One key reason is due to its different scales (molecules, individual neurons, circuits, behavior). In some cases, this can lead to varying hypotheses about the same high-level process, in this case learning.</p>

<p>Given the emergent nature of brain structure, there seems to be a tight coupling between these scales. For example, when modeling a neural its dynamics, the resulting model can be influenced by assumptions of lower-level structure, which would be na√Øve to not consider. In the case of neural circuit dynamics, the choice of single neuron model (i.e. Hodgkin-Huxley, Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, etc), could add new constraints and/or unexpected behaviors.</p>

<p><strong>Essentially, this idea comes down to recognizing when models are interconnected and understanding how assumptions can propagate across scales.</strong></p>

<p>With this in mind, I want to classify two main approaches towards building computational models that share key aspects with their biological counterparts. This formalization is not exhaustive, but can be used to classify a good portion of neuro/ai papers.</p>

<p>The first is to <strong>analyze the structure and dynamics of a neural system and then build a computational model consistent with that structure</strong>.</p>

<p>The second is to <strong>build a system which can perform an innately human task well and then identify parallels with the brain at computational and representational levels</strong> (Marr, 1976 <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5782">Link</a>). The first approach can be seen as a bottom up/emergent view, whereas the second approach a top-down/distillation view.</p>

<p><strong><span class="orange">Bottom-Up/Emergent View (Structure ‚Üí Behavior)</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Attempt to model specific aspects of brain structure (connectivity patterns, cell types, etc.)</li>
    <li>Train on a given task and observe model‚Äôs behavior w.r.t human behavior</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><span class="orange">Top-Down/Distillation View (Behavior ‚Üí Structure)</span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Identify a complex task humans are commonly able to solve</li>
    <li>Build a model using existing deep learning approaches to try and solve said task</li>
    <li>Observe model‚Äôs behavior with respect to human behavior, and draw parallels between ANN and brain structure using interpretability techiques, adversarial examples, etc.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<!-- An common approach to trying to build systems which performa is to use existing machine learning opposed to identifying what processes occur in the brain (i.e. object detection, planning) and attempting to emulate high-level behavior. For example, we see this displayed in works looking at parallels between CNNs and visio-cortical processing. Where instead of trying modeling the visual cortex by trying to model cortical neurons and connectivity patterns directly, we use our standard deep CNN architectures and observe if there are computational properties that arise similar to the visual cortex, such as edge detection and higher level processing as a function of layer depth. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07092.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07092.pdf) -->

<p>With these thoughts aside, we‚Äôll first look at a computational account of learning and synaptic plasticity in the brain known as Hebbian Learning (HL). Then, we‚Äôll draw connections to some classical and modern machine learning architectures inspired by HL including Hopfield Nets, Competing Hidden Units, and Differentiable Plasticity.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-hebbian-learning">What is Hebbian Learning?</h1>
<p>At it‚Äôs core, hebbian learning states that if two neurons <strong><span class="green underlit">i</span></strong> (pre-synaptic) and <strong><span class="green underlit">j</span></strong> (post-synaptic) connected by a synapse, <strong><span class="green underlit">s</span></strong>, the synaptic strength can be seen as a product of the pre- and post- synaptic activity, typically within the range of a small time window (300ms).</p>

<p>From a causal perspective, timing is an important factor as neuron <strong><span class="green underlit">i</span></strong> has to fire just before neuron <strong><span class="green underlit">j</span></strong> to make a potential claim that i has a role in j‚Äôs firing, a case which under Hebb‚Äôs model would lead to a synaptic strengthening.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the activity of j tends to be uncorrelated to that of i (i.e. j firing before i) then we‚Äôd tend to see a weakening of the synapse. The timing of neural activity contributing to both strengthing <strong>and weakening</strong> is captured by a generalization of Hebb‚Äôs rule known as Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP), and is a widely accepted explanation for long-term potentiation and depression of neuron populations.</p>

<h1 id="formalization-of-a-hebbian-learning-rule">Formalization of a Hebbian Learning Rule</h1>

\[\Delta w_{ij} = \alpha \cdot x_i \cdot x_j\]

<p>The Hebbian learning account provides an intuitive, experimentally backed framework for describing how synaptic weights change through time-correlated activity between neurons.</p>

<p>Synapse strengthened (weight adjustment) when post-synaptic response occurs in conjunction with pre-synaptic firing. Pre-synaptic neuron has to fire ‚Äújust before‚Äù post-synaptic neuron so causality can be inferred.</p>

<p>Hebbian learning is an account of weight adjustment between neurons</p>

<p>Hebb supports a real-time learning mechanism, where the temporal association of signals is important to the efficacy of a synapse and corresponding learning mechanisms which adjust it</p>

<p>Non real-time learning error signals computed from system responses/order of inputs and outputs, but not the exact time of occurence of each input/output</p>

<p>Hebbian LTP is seen in conjunction with Hetero-synaptic long term depression, where the receiving neuron is activated with no activation of the sending neuron. Thus, the pre-synaptic function is a difference of its activation and current synaptic weight</p>

<p>same signs ‚Üí strengthen synapse</p>

<p>opposite signs ‚Üí weaken synapse</p>
