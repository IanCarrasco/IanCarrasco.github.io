<h1 id="hi-im-ian">Hi, I’m Ian.</h1>
<p>I am an undergraduate studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science @ UC San Diego, interested in developing biologically inspired deep learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am working to develop systems that can accelerate the adoption of deep learning in new domains.</p>

<p>When I’m not thinking about deep learning and the mind, I produce music, build software, and play sports.</p>
