<p>A former jazz club on 52nd street in NYC, which I discovered after
listening to the Piano Jazz radio show hosted by Marian Macpartland, 
who was the club‚Äôs resident pianist. 52nd street during the 1940s 
and 50s was the center of the NYC jazz scene, where you could 
find artists like Thelonius Monk, Art Tatum, and Billy Holliday 
performing regularly.</p>
