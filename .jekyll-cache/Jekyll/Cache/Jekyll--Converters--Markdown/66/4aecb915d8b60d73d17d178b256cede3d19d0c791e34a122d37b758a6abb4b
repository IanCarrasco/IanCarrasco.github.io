I"¼<p>The chords used in jazz piano evoke a certain quality and richness that is achieved through the use of extensions and open voicings. Here, I quickly talk about two particular examples derived from Herbie Hancock and Kenny Barron that I particularly like.</p>

<h2 id="kenny-baron-spread-voicing">Kenny Baron Spread Voicing</h2>

<p>The Kenny Baron voicing is built on a set of stacked fifth intervals (fifths) like so. It has a much more open sound compared to the following voicing due to the larger intervals in the right hand.</p>

<h3 id="formula">Formula</h3>
<p><strong><span class="orange">Left Hand:</span></strong> Root - Up 5th - Up 5th</p>

<p><strong><span class="orange">Right Hand:</span></strong> Minor or Major 3rd - Up 5th - Up 5th</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Chord: Am7</p>

<p>Root note is A</p>

<p>Left  Hand: <strong><span class="green">A</span></strong> (Root) + <strong><span class="green">E</span></strong> (5th from A) + <strong><span class="green">B</span></strong> (5th from E)</p>

<p>Right Hand: <strong><span class="green">C</span></strong> (Minor 3rd in A) + <strong><span class="green">G</span></strong> (5th from C) + <strong><span class="green">D</span></strong> (5th from G)</p>

<h2 id="herbie-hancock-spread-voicing">Herbie Hancock Spread Voicing</h2>

<p>The Herbie Hancock voicing is built on a set of stacked fifth intervals (fifths) in the left hand similar to the Barron voicings but uses a more closed right hand which adds tension. (Major/Minor chord in 3rd inversion)</p>

<h3 id="formula-1">Formula</h3>
<p><strong><span class="orange">Left Hand:</span></strong> Root - Up 5th - Up 5th</p>

<p><strong><span class="orange">Right Hand:</span></strong> Minor/Major 6th - Up 4th - Up Minor 3rd</p>

<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>Chord: Am7</p>

<p>Root note is A</p>

<p>Left  Hand: <strong><span class="green">A</span></strong> (Root) + <strong><span class="green">E</span></strong> (5th from A) + <strong><span class="green">B</span></strong> (5th from E)</p>

<p>Right Hand: <strong><span class="green">G</span></strong> (Minor 6th in A) + <strong><span class="green">C</span></strong> (4th from G) + <strong><span class="green">Eb</span></strong> (Minor 3rd from C)</p>
