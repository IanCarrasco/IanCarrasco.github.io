I"&<p>Questions are often seen (incorrectly) in many scenarios as illuminating one’s lack of understanding. I mean you are asking a question because you didn’t fully understand some information presented to you, right? Wrong. Questions are much more nuanced than they might seem in the crude form described above, a form which acts as a barrier for many people to ask a question in the first place. I view questions as one of the most powerful tools for understanding topics deeply, demonstrating knowledge, and having awareness of intricacies.</p>
