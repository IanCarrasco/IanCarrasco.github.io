I",<p>With the start of the new decade Iâ€™ve been thinking
about what technologies might define it whether it be
(AR, AI, Edge Computing, 5G, etc.). When evaluating 
developments and trends in consumer tech and research, I found
myself continually thinking about the dynamics of how 
new technologies are adopted in society and make their way 
into the status quo. In particular, I came up with a 
concept I call <em>technological inertia</em>, whose definition
might be trivial, but I felt succinctly captures an important 
consideration when ideating.</p>
