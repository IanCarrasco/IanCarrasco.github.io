I"“<p>With the start of the new decade Iâ€™ve been thinking
about what technologies might define it whether it be
(AR, AI, Edge Computing, etc.). When evaluating 
developments and trends in consumer tech and research, I found
myself continually thinking about the dynamics of how 
new technologies are adopted in society and make their way 
into the status quo. In particular, I came up with a 
term known as <em>technological inertia</em>, whose definition
might be trivial but I felt succinctly captures an important 
consideration when ideating.</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
<p>An idea has to be familiar enough that the learning/adoption curve is relatively
small and could be intially adopted by those who are comfortable with existing technological norms. However, 
the idea has to add enough value or novelty to existing solutions, that one would give up using pre-existing 
technology in order to use it. When the balance of familiarity and innovation is not level, this causes inertia
in consumers adopting a product. The term is derived from inertia in classical mechanics, which is an objectâ€™s 
resistance to change or tendency to stay at rest.</p>
