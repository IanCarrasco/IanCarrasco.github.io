### <span class="orange">Summer 2020</span> | ML Engineering Intern @ ServiceNow
>Performed benchmarks and experimented with runtime improvements for document clustering using Python.
>Prototyped an asynchronous training job manager integrating Servicenow's AI offerings using Python and Falcon.

### <span class="orange">Winter 2020</span> | Software Engineering Intern @ Google
>Researched the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) using Tensorflow to perform end-to-end translation of satellite imagery to map features. Developed a novel architecture based on dilated convoluations for generation of images that require spatial context, produced qualitatively better results than Pix2Pix.

### <span class="orange">Summer 2019</span> | Systems Engineering Intern @ ServiceNow
>Developed domain-specific modeling techniques for anomaly detection in mail
>server logs using Splunk and Python. Additionally, built a notification system using the Slack API to reduce incident triage times from several days to ~2 hours.
