I mean you are asking a question because you didn’t fully understand some information presented to you, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions are much more nuanced than they might seem in the form described above, a form which acts as a barrier for many people to ask questions in the first place. I view questions as one of the most powerful tools for understanding topics deeply, demonstrating knowledge, and having awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obsessive question asking keeps your mind on edge and rewards naivety. There are questions that may seem so base or fundamental at the surface many people overlook them and consequently having a harder time answering them. By asking these fundamental questions you put yourself in a postition to understand topics from the bottom up when it certain aspects have already been placed in “common knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst children, there is a phase where they ask questions about the world in this obsessive way, as for them it is the only way to learn about why things are the way they are. As one gets older, however, question asking tends to slowly subside, due to much more consideration of how questions might be perceived by others. 
While it is an important consideration, don’t let it obstruct you’re own internal thought processes where these questions intially come up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, be the person in the room that asks the questions nobody else will, in the minimum case it just further reaffirms understanding, in the best case it changes one’s understanding. So ask on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Perspective" /><summary type="html">Questions are often seen (incorrectly) in many scenarios as illuminating one’s lack of understanding.

Here, I quickly talk about two particular examples derived from Herbie Hancock and Kenny Barron that I particularly like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kenny-baron-spread-voicing&quot;&gt;Kenny Baron Spread Voicing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kenny Baron voicing is built on a set of stacked fifth intervals (fifths) like so. It has a much more open sound compared to the following voicing due to the larger intervals in the right hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formula&quot;&gt;Formula&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Left Hand:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Root - Up 5th - Up 5th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Right Hand:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Minor or Major 3rd - Up 5th - Up 5th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chord: Am7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root note is A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left  Hand: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Root) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5th from A) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5th from E)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right Hand: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Minor 3rd in A) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5th from C) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5th from G)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;herbie-hancock-spread-voicing&quot;&gt;Herbie Hancock Spread Voicing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Herbie Hancock voicing is built on a set of stacked fifth intervals (fifths) in the left hand similar to the Barron voicings but uses a more closed right hand which adds tension. (Major/Minor chord in 3rd inversion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formula-1&quot;&gt;Formula&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Left Hand:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Root - Up 5th - Up 5th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Right Hand:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Minor/Major 6th - Up 4th - Up Minor 3rd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example-1&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chord: Am7&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Root note is A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left  Hand: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Root) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5th from A) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5th from E)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right Hand: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;G&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Minor 6th in A) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (4th from G) + &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Eb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Minor 3rd from C)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Music" /><summary type="html">The chords used in jazz piano evoke a certain quality and richness that is achieved through the use of extensions and open voicings.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going into a new company with a mindset of trying to learn from everyone.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Everyone knows something that you don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Have humility, but be bold enough to take risks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to enjoy what you are doing FIRST! If you aren’t, find it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the time for what matters (Health, Family, Relationships)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;And make sure to spend that time with people not devices&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Important to consider what &lt;strong&gt;and how&lt;/strong&gt; you do something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deal with adversity, don’t try to avoid it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ashlee-vance---elon-musk-biography&quot;&gt;Ashlee Vance - Elon Musk Biography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be &lt;strong&gt;highly data-driven&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rational&lt;/strong&gt; when making decisions and analyzing failures. This can be through extensively logging metrics, adding new sensors, etc… &lt;strong&gt;Prevent making the same mistake twice at all costs&lt;/strong&gt;.
This was heavily emphasized due to the large time and financial investment with SpaceX testing, but still should be generally applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Principles First Thinking - &lt;strong&gt;Don’t accept ideas on the basis of them being around for a long time&lt;/strong&gt;.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What made Tesla and SpaceX so innovative was the removal of a lot of the beureaucratic, slow development cycles that have plagued the automotive and aerospace industries. Think if an important component of a product can be redesigned to be faster, better, and cheaper, before accepting existing options. If the investment in optimizing this one part is too high that it could stunt overall progress, then evaluate other options.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to well-structured arguments and don’t base resulting decisions on the merits of the people presenting them, but rather the argument in its logical form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loyalty and determination arises in the presence of adversity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to &lt;strong&gt;surround yourself with the best&lt;/strong&gt;. Know the places that the people you look up to frequent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set ambitious deadlines&lt;/strong&gt; in order to have work materialize faster. In the case that
a project runs longer than expected, there is still room to stay on schedule in the near-term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;john-ousterhout---a-philosophy-of-software-design-talk&quot;&gt;John Ousterhout - A Philosophy of Software Design Talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build deeper classes as opposed to shallow classes. Don’t have interfaces whose cost of use is greater than the functionality it wraps (benefit). Treating classes in this cost benefit analysis approach can reduce complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create deep abstractions, don’t add layers where they are not needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The common use case for a given class should be easy, but still make edge cases possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimize places exceptions are caught.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Exceptions are most useful when they are thrown far.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design software for the future, going 10% slower today to make the right design choices, as they propagate in an engineering org.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tactical programmers just aim to have something work with minimal consideration of software design.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Having an engineering cultures that value software design principles attracts top talent.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hire for slope not y-intercept.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Potential to learn quickly and grow (slope), is more valuable than the experience coming in (y-intercept), in most cases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming posts, I’m going to break down some
of the foundational and recent work in neuroscience-inspired
AI or NeuroAI for short. I believe this field has a lot of 
promise in regards to building systems that have general 
intelligence and reasoning capabilities. In their current state, deep learning architectures under-represent
several of the structural and dynamical aspects of neurons and their corresponding networks seen in the brain. Some 
of these aspects include cell diversity, spatial organization, and neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While taking the approach of applying known phenomena from neuroscience to AI can lead to interesting, novel developments, it
is still in its infancy. A more common approach that is to ask if existing mechanisms are biologically plausible. It could very well be the case that staying true to biological limitations may not be the proper approach. One such reason could be due to the fundamental differences in computation that occur across different substrates (human brains and computers). Continuing with this point, neuroscience should be viewed as a source of inspiration rather than a guide to follow strictly. As more developments occur,this dichotomy might change but only time will tell. I find this area to be particularly exciting as it makes one consider the assumptions made about the brain that influenced the design of artificial neural networks. Additionally and most importantly, it provides a basis to challenge these assumptions with new algorithms and architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first post in the series will be about the principle of &lt;strong&gt;Hebbian Learning&lt;/strong&gt;. Which is colloquially known via the popular phrase
“neurons that fire together wire together”. We will first look at the principle from a neuroscience lens, then move into its
computational formulation by looking at a paper by Miconi, Clune, et al. (Uber AI), &lt;em&gt;Differentiable plasticity: training plastic neural networks with backpropagation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;neuroscientific-considerations&quot;&gt;Neuroscientific Considerations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-problem-of-scales&quot;&gt;The Problem Of Scales&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how learning occurs in the brain is a key problem in neuroscience. Learning, along with other high level mechanisms (i.e. vision, planning), are difficult to address due to the different scales which they can be analyzed from (i.e. individual neurons -&amp;gt; neural populations -&amp;gt; observable behavior). In some cases, this leads to varying hypotheses about the same underlying process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the emergent nature of brain structures, there is an inherent coupling between scales. For example, when modeling neural circuit dynamics, the resulting model can be influenced by assumptions of lower-level structure. One assumption in this case is the choice of single neuron model (i.e. Hodgkin-Huxley, Leaky Integrate-and-Fire, etc.) and such a choice could impose new constraints and/or unexpected behaviors. &lt;strong&gt;Essentially, this idea comes down to recognizing when models are interconnected and understanding how assumptions can propagate across scales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/pyramidal.levels.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/levels.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Levels of analysis in the brain &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Terrence Sejnowski&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two-accounts-of-neuro-ai-modeling&quot;&gt;Two Accounts of Neuro-AI Modeling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the consideration of scales addressed, I classify two main approaches towards building computational models that share function(s) with their biological counterparts. This formalization is not exhaustive, but can be used to classify a good portion of neuro/ai papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to &lt;strong&gt;analyze the structure and dynamics of a neural mechanism&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;build a computational model consistent with that structure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is to &lt;strong&gt;build a system which can perform an innately human task well&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;identify parallels with the brain at computational and representational levels&lt;/strong&gt; [1]. The first approach can be seen as a bottom up/emergent view, whereas the second approach a top-down/distillation view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Bottom-Up/Emergent View (Structure → Behavior)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Attempt to model specific aspects of brain structure (connectivity patterns, cell types, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Train model on a given task and observe model’s behavior w.r.t human behavior&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Top-Down/Distillation View (Behavior → Structure)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Identify a complex task humans are commonly able to solve&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Build a model using existing deep learning approaches to try and solve said task&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Observe model’s behavior with respect to human behavior, and draw parallels between model and brain structure after the fact using interpretability techiques (adversarial examples, activation maps, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instructive example of the bottom up view comes from the topic of studying backpropagation in the brain. In particular, it is common to see analaysis of synaptic information processing in the brain observed and then applied to existing computational models. Lillicrap et al. [2], demonstrates this with an biologically plausible form of backpropagation called feedback alignment, which follows from evidence that there is no precise backward connectivity in the brain. With consideration of biological constraints, the authors proposed a model which allows propagation of error signals to hidden layer neurons without an explicit backward pass (no requirement of backward connectivity patterns). This work, along with many others in the space [3] [4] [5], employ a similar approach of taking inspiration from neuroscience studies and adapting specific properties to existing architectures. The topic of biologically plausible techniques for error propagation will be looked at in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the top-down approach can best be seen with research of feature extractors in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Hubel and Wiesel [6] noted that cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) tend to respond to locally oriented edges within small receptive fields. Following this, the neurons in subsequent layers have signficant responses to more complex features (i.e. V4 responding to shape outlines) [7]. This information helps when looking parallels between convolutional layers and visual cortex layers as a function of their depth in a network or pathway. An overview [8] elaborates on this particular relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these thoughts aside, we’ll first look at a computational account of learning and synaptic plasticity in the brain known as Hebbian Learning (HL). Then, we’ll draw connections to some classical and modern machine learning architectures inspired by HL including Hopfield Nets, Competing Hidden Units, and Differentiable Plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hebb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-hebbian-learning&quot;&gt;What is Hebbian Learning?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At it’s core, hebbian learning states that if two neurons &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green underlit&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (pre-synaptic) and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green underlit&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (post-synaptic) connected by a synapse, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green underlit&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the synaptic strength can be seen as a product of the pre- and post- synaptic activity, typically within the range of a small time window (300ms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a causal perspective, timing is an important factor as neuron &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green underlit&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has to fire just before neuron &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;green underlit&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to make a potential claim that i has a role in j’s firing, a case which under Hebb’s model would lead to a synaptic strengthening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the activity of j tends to be uncorrelated to that of i (i.e. j firing before i) then we’d tend to see a weakening of the synapse. The timing of neural activity contributing to both strengthing &lt;strong&gt;and weakening&lt;/strong&gt; is captured by an larger concept, which Hebbian learning falls under, known as Spike Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP), and is a widely accepted explanation for long-term potentiation(strengthening) and depression(weakening) of connectivity in neuron populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;formalization-of-a-hebbian-learning-rule&quot;&gt;Formalization of a Hebbian Learning Rule&lt;/h1&gt;

\[\Delta w_{ij} = \alpha \cdot x_i \cdot x_j\]

&lt;p&gt;In its most basic form, the hebbian learning rule states that a synaptic weight (w_ij), is derived from the paired activity of its pre- and post- synaptic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case 1: High Pre- and Post- Activity (Large Weight)
Case 2: High Pre- and Low- Post and vice versa (Small Weight)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hebbian learning account provides an intuitive, experimentally backed framework for describing how synaptic weights change through time-correlated activity between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synapse strengthened (weight adjustment) when post-synaptic response occurs in conjunction with pre-synaptic firing. Pre-synaptic neuron has to fire “just before” post-synaptic neuron so causality can be inferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebbian learning is an account of weight adjustment between neurons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebb supports a real-time learning mechanism, where the temporal association of signals is important to the efficacy of a synapse and corresponding learning mechanisms which adjust it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non real-time learning error signals computed from system responses/order of inputs and outputs, but not the exact time of occurence of each input/output&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebbian LTP is seen in conjunction with Hetero-synaptic long term depression, where the receiving neuron is activated with no activation of the sending neuron. Thus, the pre-synaptic function is a difference of its activation and current synaptic weight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;same signs → strengthen synapse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;opposite signs → weaken synapse&lt;/p&gt;

about what technologies might define it whether it be
(AR, AI, Edge Computing, 5G, etc.). When evaluating 
developments and trends in consumer tech and research, I found
myself continually thinking about the dynamics of how 
new technologies are adopted in society and make their way 
into the status quo. In particular, I came up with a 
concept I call &lt;em&gt;technological inertia&lt;/em&gt;, whose definition
might be trivial, but I felt succinctly captures an important 
consideration when ideating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea has to be familiar enough that the learning/adoption curve is relatively
small such that it could be intially adopted by those who are comfortable with existing technological norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the idea has to add enough value or novelty to existing solutions, that one would give up using pre-existing 
technology in order to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers have inherent inertia, a tendency to stick with what works. When the balance of &lt;strong&gt;familiarity and innovation&lt;/strong&gt; of an idea is not level, this inertial force is greater than the “force”(marketing, innovation, design) of an idea. Thus, leading to minimal or low adoption. If this balance is maintained, an idea will have a much better chance at being adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The term is derived from inertia in classical mechanics, which is an object’s resistance to change or tendency to stay at rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Perspective" /><summary type="html">With the start of the new decade I’ve been thinking about what technologies might define it whether it be (AR, AI, Edge Computing, 5G, etc.).
