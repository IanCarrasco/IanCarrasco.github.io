# Hi, I'm Ian.
I am an undergraduate studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science @ UC San Diego, interested in developing biologically inspired deep learning algorithms. 

Additionally, I am working to develop systems that can accelerate the adoption of deep learning in new domains. 

When I'm not thinking about deep learning and the mind, I produce music, build software, and play sports.
